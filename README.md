# RockiPocki

Welcome to the Rocki Pocki! This is a mock business website designed to showcase and sell high-quality rocks. The website is fully responsive, meaning it adapts and provides an optimal viewing experience across various screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktop computers. The layout and styling have been implemented using flexbox, and clickable navigation has been created using anchors.

## Technologies Used

HTML: The structure and content of the website.
CSS: The styles and layout of the website, including the use of flexbox.

The design for this site was created in Figma. [View the Figma design here](https://www.figma.com/file/0Cyjk7cEczMwV67BqLWaP1/Rocki-Pocki-Mocki?type=design&node-id=1%3A2&mode=design&t=DWWKL9522AmeooKz-1)
